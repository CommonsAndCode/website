### Jan Peter König (Treasurer)

Jan Peter König is the association’s system architect.
With over 15 years of international experience in cloud computing and networks, he sees strong parallels between software architecture and sociological processes.
He has applied this analytical lens for six years in the political "engine room" to safeguard democratic processes: chairing meetings, facilitating elections, and advising on strategy, law, and governance.
Influenced by Richard Stallman in 2013, he became a staunch advocate of copyleft.
When he isn't building structures, he is on the move: A passionate motorcyclist and railway enthusiast, he prefers exploring the world on two wheels or on rails.

## Non-executive Board

### Lisa Gerlach

Lisa Gerlach is a local politician in the Landschaftsverband Rheinland (LVR) and a judge at the regional arbitration court of Volt NRW.
As a business graduate and consultant with a social focus, she is committed to justice, culture and participation.
She is a single mum to two cats, a dog and three grown-up sons.
In her private life, she shares an allotment garden where the vegetables grow in a decidedly wayward manner.

### Sascha Mann

Sascha Mann is a student and climbing instructor.
In the political field, he cofounded Volt Europe's digital community and shaped the party's digital policies.
Outside of his political engagement he spends a lot of time in climbing gyms or out in nature at climbing crags.

Toni is the dog who is also half cat, or at least lives with them.
He was born by the sea under palm trees and loves coconuts.
At club meetings, he wants to be pet a lot and spreads good humour, just like at the founding meeting.
