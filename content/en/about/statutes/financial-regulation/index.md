In accordance with Paragraph 3(5) of the Statutes, the general meeting
of members shall adopt the following financial regulations:

## § 1 Membership fees

1. The minimum annual membership fee for natural and legal persons shall be EUR 10,00/month.

1. For members with no or low income, a reduced minimum amount of EUR 2.50/month may be granted by the Board for a limited period. The Governing Board may derogate from this minimum amount.

1. The membership fee is due in advance on 1 January of each year. In the case of accession during the current financial year, the contribution shall be calculated pro rata from the month of accession, with months beginning to be paid in full.

1. At the request of the Member, payment may be made on a quarterly basis, provided that the corresponding fraction is equal to or greater than EUR 20.00. The request must be sent in writing or by e-mail to the Governing Board.

1. There is no claim for reimbursement of membership fees paid. This applies in particular to the termination of membership during the current financial year.

## § 2 Arrears and order for payment procedure

1. If a Member defaults on payment of the membership fee, they will receive a written reminder by e-mail or by post. The reminder shall specify a reasonable period for payment of at least four weeks.

1. In accordance with Article 3(6) of the Statutes, if a member is in arrears for more than six months with his or her contribution, the Board of Directors may, in accordance with Article 3(6) of the Statutes, decide to exclude the member.

1. Exclusion from the association does not exempt the payment of arrears. The association’s contribution claims remain unaffected by the exclusion.

## § 3 Allowances and travel expenses

1. Members acting on behalf of the Association are entitled to reimbursement of their necessary expenses.

1. Travel expenses are reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Travel Costs Act (BRKG), as amended.

1. Expenses shall be reimbursed only on presentation of supporting documents and shall be subject to prior approval by the Board of Directors.

## § 4 Entry into force

These Financial Regulations shall enter into force on the date on which
they are adopted.
