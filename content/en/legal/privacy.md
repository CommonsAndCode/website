Personal data is data that can be used to personally identify you. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p> <p>We point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., when communicating via email) can have security vulnerabilities.

<h3>Storage Duration</h3> <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will occur after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
<h3>General Information on the Legal Basis of Data Processing on This Website</h3> <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for contract fulfillment or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Information about the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
<h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3> <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transmission of personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if this is necessary in the context of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the disclosure, or if another legal basis permits the data disclosure. When using processors, we only pass on personal data from our customers on the basis of a valid contract on commissioned processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract on joint processing is concluded.</p>
<h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3> <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p> <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
<h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3> <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3> <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
<h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3> <p>Within the framework of applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing, and if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time regarding this and other questions about personal data.</p>
<h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3> <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p> <ul> <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li> <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li> <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li> <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li> </ul> <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may – apart from being stored – only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>
<h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3> <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p> <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
<h3>Objection to Advertising Emails</h3> <p>The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation to send unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby objected to. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as through spam emails.</p>
<h2>4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>
<h3>Inquiry by Email, Phone, or Fax</h3> <p>If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p> <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries directed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; consent can be revoked at any time.</p> <p>The data you send to us via contact requests remains with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions – in particular legal retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>
<h2>5. Newsletter</h2>
<h3>Newsletter Data</h3> <p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an email address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and agree to receive the newsletter. Further data is not collected or is collected only on a voluntary basis. We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p> <p>The processing of data entered into the newsletter registration form is carried out exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke the consent given to the storage of data, the email address, and their use for sending the newsletter at any time, for example via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality of data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p> <p>The data you have deposited with us for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you cancel the newsletter or after the purpose no longer applies. We reserve the right to delete or block email addresses from our newsletter distribution list at our own discretion within the framework of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p> <p>Data stored with us for other purposes remains unaffected.</p> <p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist if necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and is not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Storage in the blacklist is not limited in time. <strong>You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong></p>
